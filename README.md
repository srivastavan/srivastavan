### Welcome to my Github Page 🤗

- 👋 I’m Namrata
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring how data science techniques can be applied to real-life datasets. 
- 🌱 I’m currently an educational data scientist, and have experience working with large scale educational datasets.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to exploring new research domains (healthcare, business analytics, speech recognition,...) and keep improving my analytical skills.

Happy coding 😅
